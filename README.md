1st Year Spring Boot Web Application Final Project - KEA

In order to run the project on your computer, make sure you have maven installed. 

Run 
```bash
$mvn -version 
```
to check if you have it on your machine.

If it is not installed, follow instructions from https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac .

Once you made sure maven is installed, pull the project and inside the main project folder run: 
```bash
$mvn install
```

This command will build maven project for you. Once that is done, you can run the application and see it on localhost:1212.
